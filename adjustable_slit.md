#Assembly

## Step 1:
Take the [Compliant-slit flex - layer 1]{qty: 1, cat: PrintedPart} and join it with the [Compliant-slit flex - layer 2]{qty: 1, cat: PrintedPart}, leaving the [Blades]{qty:1} and the [HEX screw][M3 x 25mm HEX screw]{qty:1} in the middle of them. The idea is to leave captured the head of the screw and the sharp edges of the blades in the center.

## Step 2;
Put two [M3 x 5mm screw]{qty: 1} through the assembled piece to hold the blades previously inserted and tight with the [2.5mm Ball-end Allen key]{qty:1}.

## Step 3:
Place the [cap][Compliant-slit flex - cap]{qty: 1, cat: PrintedPart}, closing the mechanism.

## Step 4:
Paste the [Knob][Slit Knob]{qty: 1, cat: PrintedPart} with the screw tip using a strong glue.

##Step 5: Put it in a cube!

Take one of your [UC2 cubes](UC2files.md) and place your assembled piece in it. You can purchase the cube or 3D print it, either option works fine.
