Appropriate technology open source light sheet microscope design, for 3d imaging and high-throughput droplet cytometry.
This is a modification of the OpenUC2 light sheet design - a project that can be explored by [website](https://openuc2.de) and [GitHub](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT). This version has been developed as part of a [crowd funded project](https://experiment.com/projects/developing-a-low-cost-high-sensitivity-solution-for-phage-viral-load-detection) on experiment.com by Tobias Wenzel and Benedict Diederich. In the Wenzel Lab, Mat√≠as Hurtado has also contributed to the design of several cubes, and the re-design of Inventor designs of [UC2 cubes in OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6ad90b1b9211810137d71b1d/w/b1b0cc05a0494bf4bc912f91/e/37e5ce9fc21af2a3e931ec46?configuration=Distances%3D0.03%2Bmeter&renderMode=0&uiState=668f4aab4587f461c0a71ce5).

Illumination arm:
1) Fiber coupler, colimator, 5mm mask, all mounted on one threaded UC2 insert. Fiber coupler and colimator: Thorlabs AD11F with F280FC-A. The 5mm mask was 3d printed to cut the beam to the optimal size for the Powell lense.
3) Powell-lense and optional slit

5) kinematic mirror (optional if using a straight illumination arm or a shorter focal length cylindrical lense)
6) empty
7) sample holder
8) XYZ stage for sample
   
Detection arm:
10) 1- 5x Objective
  2- Focus motor 
11) 1- Optical filter
