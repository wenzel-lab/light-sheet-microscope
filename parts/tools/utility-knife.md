# Utility knife / Box cutter

Any standard utility knife should work for simple jobs like removing a brim.


A retractable or fixed-blade utility knife should work. This is probably safer than a scalpel, but should still be used with caution! A Stanley Titan fixed blade knife is a high quality option with replaceable blades that are fixed rather than retractable.
