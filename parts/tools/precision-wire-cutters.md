# Precision wire cutters

![](../../images/Tools-and-Parts/Precision-wire-cutters.jpg)

Precision wire cutters, sometimes called flush cutters, are wire cutters that come to a sharp point and have a flat back surface. This allows small wires and 3D-printed supports to be cut flush against another surface. These are useful for removing small 3D-printed ties that hold the microscope together during printing.
